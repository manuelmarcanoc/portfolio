## Style Guidelines:

- Background color: Light sky blue (#E1F5FE), inspired by the sky in the reference image, evokes openness and creativity.
- Primary color: Lime green (#C0FF00), matching the bubbly design elements of the example site, will be applied to icons and the call to action to download the cv.
- Accent color: Dark blue (#00264D), this analogous color contrasts well with lime, and emphasizes key elements of the site.
- Headline font: 'Poppins' sans-serif for titles and key information, giving a fresh and stylish look. This will match with fonts used on example image provided.
- Body font: 'PT Sans' sans-serif for descriptions and general information, making it very legible. This pairing is suggested because PT Sans matches with fonts used on example image provided.
- Create custom icons in the bubbly, hand-drawn style as per the original image, with each icon representing a different section of the portfolio (About, Education, Skills, etc.).
- Use a floating layout of interactive components on top of background. Arrange section icons as floating objects to create a modern, cloud-like, and playful user interface, imitating the design in the original picture.
- Subtle animations: add subtle hover effects to icons and buttons to show visual feedback and make it delightful to interact with your digital portfolio.
